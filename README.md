#eyequation-android

An Android app that recognizes and solves images of mathematical expressions. This app was developed by Nico Chaves and Noam Weinberger as a class project for EE 368 (Digital Image Processing) at Stanford University during Autumn 2016.

This app builds upon several projects: Tesseract OCR, android-ocr by rmtheis, and javaluator.

Tesseract OCR engine: [tess-two](https://github.com/rmtheis/tess-two)

## Video (coming soon)

## Installation

Clone or download the project. Open it in Android Studio and run (Android Studio may prompt you to install the build tools for the project's SDK).
Once you install the app, your Android device should prompt you to install OpenCV Manager (unless you already have done so in the past).
